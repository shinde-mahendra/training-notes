# Jenkins Free style Job
A Jenkins freestyle job is a type of project that allows you to define a sequence of steps to perform a task, such as building or deploying a project. It provides a flexible and straightforward way to configure and manage your automation processes.

## Key Features

- **Build Steps**: Define a series of steps to execute, such as shell commands, batch scripts, or invoking other build tools like Maven or Gradle.
- **Post-Build Actions**: Configure actions to perform after the build, such as archiving artifacts, sending notifications, or triggering other jobs.
- **Source Code Management (SCM)**: Integrate with version control systems like Git, Subversion, or Mercurial to fetch the source code for your project.
- **Build Triggers**: Set up triggers to start the job automatically, such as polling the SCM, scheduling builds, or responding to webhooks.
- **Build Environment**: Configure the environment for the build, including setting environment variables, using custom workspace locations, or throttling concurrent builds.
- **Parameters**: Define parameters to make your job configurable, allowing you to pass different values for each build.

## Configuration Options

- **General**: Set job description, discard old builds, and enable the job as parameterized.
- **Source Code Management**: Configure the SCM settings to fetch the source code.
- **Build Triggers**: Set up triggers to initiate the build process.
- **Build Environment**: Specify environment settings for the build.
- **Build Steps**: Define the steps to execute during the build process.
- **Post-Build Actions**: Configure actions to perform after the build completes.

## Options under `General` stage

**Discard Old Builds**:
This option helps manage storage by automatically discarding old build artifacts. You can set conditions like the maximum number of builds to keep or the maximum number of days to retain builds.

**This project is parameterized**:
Enabling this option allows you to define parameters that can be used during the build process. For example, you can prompt for user inputs like strings, choices, or files, and these parameters can be accessed within the build script.

**Throttle Builds**:
This feature allows you to control the number of concurrent builds that can run. You can specify a maximum number of builds to be executed simultaneously, which helps manage resource usage and prevent overloading your build server.

**Execute concurrent builds if necessary**:
This option permits multiple builds to run concurrently for the same project. It's useful when you have multiple build requests and want to speed up the process by executing them in parallel.


## Build Triggers in Jenkins Jobs

Build Triggers in Jenkins allow you to automate the initiation of your jobs based on certain conditions or events. These triggers help ensure that your build process is efficient, timely, and responsive to changes.

### Common Build Triggers

- **Poll SCM**: Periodically checks the source control system (like Git) for changes. If changes are detected, a new build is triggered. 
  - Example: `H/5 * * * *` (polls every 5 minutes)

- **Build Periodically**: Schedules builds at regular intervals using cron-like syntax. This is useful for running jobs at specific times or dates.
  - Example: `@daily` (runs once a day)

- **GitHub Hook Trigger for GITScm Polling**: Automatically triggers a build when a commit is pushed to a GitHub repository. This requires configuring a webhook in GitHub.

- **Trigger builds remotely (e.g., from scripts)**: Allows builds to be triggered via an external source, such as a script or a URL. A unique token is used to authenticate the trigger.
  - Example: `http://your-jenkins-url/job/your-job-name/build?token=TOKEN_NAME`

- **Build after other projects are built**: Triggers a build of the current project after one or more specified projects have been built successfully. This is useful for creating a chain of dependent jobs.

- **Build after other projects are completed**: Similar to the previous trigger, but starts the build irrespective of the build result of the upstream project.

### Example Configuration

Here is an example configuration for setting up build triggers in a Jenkins job:

```yaml
Build Triggers:
  - Poll SCM: 
    - Schedule: H/5 * * * *
  - Build Periodically: 
    - Schedule: @daily
  - GitHub Hook Trigger: true
  - Trigger Builds Remotely: 
    - URL: http://your-jenkins-url/job/your-job-name/build?token=TOKEN_NAME
  - Build After Other Projects Are Built: 
    - Projects: another-job-name
```

## Demo 1

1. Login into Jenkins with Admin User
1. Goto Jenkins Dashboard (Use Top Left Corner Logo of Jenkins)
1. Click on "New Item" in left side navigation panel.

  ```yml 
  Item-Name: Job1
  Item-Type: Freestyle project
  ```
1. Click Ok to start creating a new job
1. Using left side navigation panel, goto "General" and enter description for the project `Sample Job`
1. Using left side navigation panel, goto "Build Steps"
1. Click on `Add Build Step` then choose `Execute Windows Batch Command`
1. Enter the command

   ```cmd
   echo "Hello World"
   ```
1.  Click on `Save` button
1.  Now try to `Run` the job at least three times.
1.  Jenkins Dashboard -> Job1 -> In left side panel, there should LIST OF BUILDs
1.  Now, using windows explorer, explore the folder `C:\Users\AzureAdmin\.Jenkins\Jobs\job1`
