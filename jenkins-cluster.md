# Jenkins Cluster

## Jenkins Cluster Components
1. **Master Node**: This is the central control node that manages the entire Jenkins cluster. It schedules jobs, distributes tasks to worker nodes, and monitors their progress.
2. **Worker Nodes (Slaves)**: These nodes perform the actual build tasks assigned by the master node. Each worker node can have multiple executors, which are processes that run the build jobs.

## How It Works
- **Job Distribution**: When a build job is triggered, the master node assigns it to one of the available worker nodes.
- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple build jobs can run in parallel across different worker nodes, speeding up the overall build process.
- **Scalability**: You can add more worker nodes to the cluster to handle increased load or to distribute tasks more efficiently.
- **Auto-Discovery**: Some setups allow worker nodes to automatically register themselves with the master node, making it easier to scale the cluster.

## Benefits
- **Efficiency**: Distributing tasks across multiple nodes can significantly reduce build times.
- **Scalability**: Easily add more nodes to handle larger workloads.
- **Redundancy**: If one node fails, others can take over its tasks, ensuring continuous operation.
